To run the code please ensure the correct folder is selected from the desired location and all files are present within the location. These files are as follows: 
	- MantelGroup.csproj
	- Program.cs
	- testclass.cs
	- test_data.log
	- unit_tests.log
	- .vscode (folder)
	- bin (folder)
	- obj (folder)

Line 24 of the 'Program.cs' file includes the filepath for the test data to be run. Substitute accordingly. 

Testing script 'testclass.cs' is designed to be run on 'unit_tests.log'. Tests will fail if not compiled using this log file. 

Assumptions made when completing this task are as follows: 
	- 'Top 3' was taken to mean that only 3 outcomes were required. If URL's and / or IP addresses had the same number of visits and / or activity, the first 3 were 	   taken in alphabetical order.

**Answers obtained are as follows:**

**Unique IP Addresses** <br/>
Number of unique IP addresses: 11 <br/>

**Most Visited URLS** <br/>
mostVisitedURLs = /docs/manage-websites/, Times Visited = 2 <br/>
mostVisitedURLs = /, Times Visited = 1 <br/>
mostVisitedURLs = /asset.css, Times Visited = 1 <br/>

**Most Active IP Addressess** <br/>
TopIPAddresses = 168.41.191.40, Times Active = 4 <br/>
TopIPAddresses = 177.71.128.21, Times Active = 3 <br/>
TopIPAddresses = 50.112.00.11, Times Active = 3 <br/>
